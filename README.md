# Daggerheart Data

This repository provides JSON game data and schema definitions for the [Daggerheart System Reference Document (SRD)](https://www.daggerheart.com/srd/). Use these files to build custom websites, bots, tools, and more for our favorite TTRPG!

For example, this data powers [daggersearch.com](https://daggersearch.com)
