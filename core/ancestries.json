      "en-US": "Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety of materials, including metal, wood, and stone. They can resemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes. Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. Many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it's also common for clanks to build one another. A clank's lifespan extends as long as they're able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency."

New teeth grow throughout a Drakona's approximately 600-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don't have wings and can't fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona's elemental power will differ from the rest of their family's."

Infernis are passionate and ambitious, with a reputation for boldness and determination. Their societies are structured around personal achievement and strength of will, and many infernis seek to prove themselves through feats of courage or cunning. Despite their origins, infernis are not inherently evil and often strive to define their own destinies."
